I developed a fully responsive e-learning platform using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean layout, intuitive navigation, and a visually appealing design. The objective was to create a structured and interactive website that can effectively showcase educational content in a user-friendly format.

The platform is divided into multiple key sections, including a homepage, course catalog, course details page, and a contact form. The homepage introduces the platform with a welcoming message, a brief description of its purpose, and call-to-action buttons to guide users toward exploring the courses. It also includes a visually styled navigation bar for easy access to different parts of the site.

The course catalog features a grid layout that displays multiple courses, each presented in a card format with a course title, brief description, and an image. I used CSS to enhance user interaction with hover effects and smooth transitions. Clicking on a course directs users to a dedicated course details page, which includes more in-depth information like course content, duration, and instructor information.

The contact section includes a simple, styled form that allows users to submit inquiries or feedback. Throughout the platform, consistent typography, color schemes, and spacing are applied to maintain a professional and polished appearance. Flexbox and media queries were used to ensure the layout is responsive across various devices, including tablets and smartphones.

Special attention was given to user experience, with a focus on clean code structure and semantic HTML to support accessibility and SEO best practices. Visual elements like shadows, rounded corners, and modern fonts were used to make the platform more engaging and user-friendly.

This project significantly strengthened my front-end development skills. It gave me practical experience in organizing web content, designing responsive layouts, and applying modern CSS styling techniques. Building this platform from scratch helped me better understand how educational websites are structured and how design choices can directly impact user engagement and usability.
